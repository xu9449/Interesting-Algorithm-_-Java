Question 1 How could we implement a queue by using two stacks?  
Worst caseTime = O ( 2n + 1) = O (n)
Amortized time complexity 
  
Question 2: How to implement tht min() function when using stack with time cimplexity O(1):
Solution 1 : we keep the contents from stack1 and stack2 in synchronization    
  
Follow up question : 
Assume there are a lot of duplicate elements in the input, how to optimize the space usage of stack2 ?  
  
Question 3 How to sort numbers with tree ï¼ˆtwo) stacks   ?

Question 4 How to use multiple Stacks to implement a dequeue?  
follow up : use 3 stacks to improve the time complexity of pop() operation.
